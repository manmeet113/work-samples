## Why Install WordPress on Your PC?

Installing WordPress on your computer lets you test and play with your site before making it live. It’s like a safe space where you can experiment with different settings, themes, and plugins without worrying about messing up a website that others can see.

## Prerequisites Before WordPress Installation

1. Install XAMPP from [XAMPP Website](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).

## How to Install WordPress on Your Computer

### 1. Get WordPress
- Go to the [WordPress Website](https://wordpress.org/download/) and click the "Download WordPress" button. This will download a ZIP file to your computer.

### 2. Unzip and Move the Files
- Once downloaded, unzip the WordPress folder. You should now have a folder named “wordpress.” 
- Move this folder to your web server directory. For XAMPP, paste it in `C:\xampp\htdocs\`.

### 3. Create a Database

### 4. Start Installing
- Open your browser and type `localhost/wordpress` (or the name of the folder you moved). You’ll see the WordPress setup page.
- Choose your language and click **Continue**.

### 5. Enter Your Database Info
